        <h1>7 Human Values: A Handbook on Living a Life of Purpose</h1>
        <!-- <p>
          Life happens too fast. Responsibilities jostle, dreams chase, and at
          times we forget to take time to think about what truly matters. But
          would it be that simple to make meaning a more natural part of our
          lives?
        </p>
        <p>
          The 7 Human Values-Gratitude, Forgiveness, Love, Humility, Giving,
          Patience, and Truth-are not only words but also the essence of a life
          well-lived. They shape our character, strengthen our relationships,
          and provide us with the ability to wander through challenges with
          elegance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's discover these seven values and how you can intertwine them into
          your days-one value at a time.

            <b>Gratitude (Monday) – Start the Week with Thankfulness</b>
            <p>
              Mondays can be a drag, but what if we flipped the script? Instead
              of dreading the start of the week, what if we embraced it with
              gratitude?
            </p>
            <p>
              Breathe. Reflect on three things that you're currently thankful
              for: perhaps the brew of morning coffee, the best friend checking
              up on you every now and then, or it's simply getting another
              chance at chasing dreams tomorrow. Gratitude shifts focus away
              from what one lacks toward how beautiful everything has already
              been made.

            <b>Forgiveness Tuesday – Let It Go, Get Free</b>
            <p>
              We've all been hurt. Maybe a friend betrayed you, a colleague took
              credit for your work, or someone's words left a lasting scar.
              Holding onto anger feels like power, but in reality, it weighs us
              down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Forgiveness is not about excusing what happened, but freeing you
              from the pain. Let go of the resentment, not for them, but for
              you. Imagine how much lighter your heart would feel if you stopped
              carrying that burden.
            </p>

            <b>Love (Wednesday) – Lead with an Open Heart</b>
            <p>
              Love is not just about sweeping gestures. It's in the little
              things, like the warmth of a smile you give a stranger, or the
              text to check in just because, or the way you hold space for
              someone who needs to be heard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Midweek can be overwhelming. Just pause and ask yourself, "How can
              I show love today?" It may be to yourself (yes, self-love
              matters!), your family, or even to a stranger. Little love can
              make a huge difference in someone's day.
            </p>

            <b>Humility (Thursday) – Remain open to the lessons of life</b>
            <p>
              We live in a world that celebrates confidence, but true strength
              lies in humility. Being humble doesn't mean thinking less of
              yourself; it means being open to learning, admitting mistakes, and
              understanding that everyone has a story to tell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, take some time to listen: really listen to someone. You
              might just be surprised by how much you learn when you put aside
              ego and open yourself to other people's wisdom.
